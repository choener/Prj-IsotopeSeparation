# Prj-IsotopeSeparation
Stats model that separates isotopically labelled ONT data

Meta-repository that collects the diverse parts needed for isotope separation.

Currently:
- stats model: <https://github.com/choener/IsotopeSeparation>
- "small data"
- "scripts to create links to big data" (big is everything that I can't keep on this tiny, local ssd)
